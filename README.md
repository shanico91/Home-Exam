This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

# personal note

I know it took a while for me to submit this excersize. I would have liked to perfect it more, it took me a while to study these technologies and I know that given the time to get more fluent in them I can do much better.
I hope that you'll let me prove myself.
Thank you for the opportunity!
