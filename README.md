# personal note

I know it took a while for me to submit this excersize anf that itit could have been better.
I would have liked to perfect it more, but due to the holidays and all the time that has already passed I decided to usubmit it as it is now. I hope that you'll let me prove that I can do better.
Thank you for the opportunity!
